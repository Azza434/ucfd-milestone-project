# North Street Coffee & Bistro

North Street Coffee & Bistro is a growing coffee shop in the heart of Belfast City Center, They strive to give you the best coffee in Belfast.

## UX

This website is for North Street Coffee & Bistro, They want to achieve a simplistic view and an easy to navigate website.

In this project I provided that by making one single page with everything needed at the click of a button,The header follows you as you browse through the website meaning that anytime you want to move through
the website you simply click to where you want to go and get taken there.

I added a social media dropdown menu to the header as social media is a baig thing in this day and age,The user has all the social media links at their fingertips without having to navigate to the bottom
of the webpage

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

## Features

When landing on North Street Coffee & Bistro's website you will first see a carousel with rotating pictures of beautiful cups of coffee

Next you will come across coffee explained section that gives you a little insight to the different types off coffee

Then you will reach their menu that consists of the different coffees they sell and cakes

And finally the contact us section that shows a map pointing you to their place of business and their contact details

## Technologies Used

- [JQuery]
- [HTML5]
- [CSS3]
- [Bootstrap]
- [FontAwesome]


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
