# North Street Coffee & Bistro

North Street Coffee & Bistro is a growing coffee shop in the heart of Belfast City Center, They strive to give you the best coffee in Belfast.

## UX

This website is for North Street Coffee & Bistro, They want to achieve a simplistic view and an easy to navigate website.

In this project I provided that by making one single page with everything needed at the click of a button,The header follows you as you browse through the website meaning that anytime you want to move through
the website you simply click to where you want to go and get taken there.

I added a social media dropdown menu to the header as social media is a baig thing in this day and age,The user has all the social media links at their fingertips without having to navigate to the bottom
of the webpage

## Features

When landing on North Street Coffee & Bistro's website you will first see a carousel with rotating pictures of beautiful cups of coffee

Next you will come across coffee explained section that gives you a little insight to the different types off coffee

Then you will reach their menu that consists of the different coffees they sell and cakes

And finally the contact us section that shows a map pointing you to their place of business and their contact details
